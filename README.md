# Repo to reproduce output failures for mystmd January 28, 2025

I used `myst` built from commit [`d1f8768eb4dbada0a370765ba696fbb3c00ba66f`](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/commit/d1f8768eb4dbada0a370765ba696fbb3c00ba66f).

Create a Python venv and install `jupyter-server` and `ipykernel`. Then run `myst start --execute`
